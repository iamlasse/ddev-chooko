# DDEV pull wp scripts

üßò&nbsp; *Keep calm and pull your site.* üßò

Inofficial DDEV pull and push scripts for happy local WordPress development: Pull in the latest site content to your local dev sever. Test, develop and design in peace without breaking your live site. These scripts require at least [DDEV 1.18.2](https://github.com/drud/ddev/releases/tag/v1.18.2).

Status: *Work in Progress, please use with caution.*

## Scripts

- ‚ö°Ô∏è&nbsp; [ddev pull ssh](#%EF%B8%8F--ddev-pull-ssh) - *pull a site with just one command*<br>

## Usage

## ‚ö°Ô∏è&nbsp;  ddev pull ssh

Pull in your live WordPress site via SSH (and rsync). Your webspace needs support for mysqldump and you need to be able to connect to your SSH webspace via SSH key authentication (without password).

**First time project setup**

You can as use the [Online Generator](https://mandrasch.github.io/ddev-pull-wp-generator/) or the manual approach:

1. Adjust `.ddev/config.yaml` for your needs
1. Configure `.ddev/providers/ssh.yaml` (SSH host, user and WordPress path on server)
1. Run `ddev start`
1. Run `ddev auth ssh`

Nice! You ready to pull!

**Pull in your latest site content**

1. Run `ddev pull ssh`

That's it, run `ddev launch` to open your site in the web browser. If you experience issues, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

Source code: [.ddev/providers/ssh.yaml](https://github.com/mandrasch/ddev-pull-wp-scripts/blob/main/.ddev/providers/ssh.yaml)

If you want to clean and delete all pulled filles, you can use `git clean -fdx -e .ddev`. 

## (experimental) ‚ö°Ô∏è&nbsp;  ddev push ssh

Use with caution, rsync can overwrite files or cause chaos! Always backup your live site!

This will push your child theme folder to the remote site you already configured for the pull.

- Run `ddev push ssh --skip-db`

Currently rsync is configured without `--delete`-flag, therefore no files will be deleted on remote child theme folder.

### Webhoster support

| Hosting company  | Pull tested? | Push tested ? |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Manitu (DE)  | ‚úÖ | In progress |
| Raidboxes (DE) | ‚úÖ  | In progress |
| WPEngine | In progress | In progress |
| Mittwald (DE) | In progress  | In progress |

## üíæ &nbsp;ddev pull backup

Create and (manually) download a BackWpUp backup-file from your live site, import it to your local DDEV project. No SSH required, just download your backup file and import it as .zip-file.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#DDEV_REPO=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmandrasch%2Fddev-pull-wp-scripts,DDEV_ARTIFACTS=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdrud%2Fd9simple-artifacts/https://github.com/drud/ddev-gitpod-launcher/)

Gitpod support via [drud/ddev-gitpod-launcher](https://drud.github.io/ddev-gitpod-launcher/)

**First time project setup**

1. Copy `.ddev/example.config.yaml` to `.ddev/config.yaml`
1. Configure Child theme folder name in `.ddev/config.yaml` (optional)
3. Adjust child theme folder name in `.gitignore` (optional)
4. Run `ddev start` and `ddev auth ssh`

**Import a backup:**

1. Create a backup with [BackWPup ‚Äì WordPress Backup Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/backwpup/) (Open Source) on your live site
1. Download BackWpUp .zip file to root of local project folder
1. Rename backup file to `backup.zip`
1. `ddev pull backup`
1. Open imported website in browser: `ddev launch`

Source code: [.ddev/providers/backup.yaml](https://github.com/mandrasch/ddev-pull-wp-scripts/blob/main/.ddev/providers/backup.yaml)

## Child theme deployment

You can optionally manage a child theme via git and deploy it with a tool like [WPPusher](https://wppusher.com/) or [SayHelloGmbH/git-installer](https://github.com/SayHelloGmbH/git-installer) (no git on server required, works via HTTP apis of Github, Bitbucket, etc.). This repository already contains an example child theme. 



## Technical Documentation

Pull scripts are import steps for database and files which are stored as .yaml-files in `.ddev/providers`. They can be executed via `ddev pull`. See [DDEV pull (providers)](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/providers/provider-introduction/) documentation for more insights.

 Design, test  and develop sites in local isolated [DDEV](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) project environments without breaking the live site.

### Reset / delete

- delete pulled files: `git clean -fdx -e .ddev`
    - removes all untracked files and directories (pulled files), but without deleting the DDEV folder
- reset DDEV project: `ddev delete -O`
    - deletes DDEV project with database and containers (files will be kept)
- `git clean -fdx`
    - removes all untracked files and directories
    - if .ddev/config.yaml is untracked in git, it will be removed as well (!)
    - you need to run 'ddev start' again afterwards to init

## Troubleshooting

### DDEV version correct?

Please check with `ddev -v` that you are using [DDEV 1.18.2](https://github.com/drud/ddev/releases/tag/v1.18.2) or newer.

### Database dump doesn't work - only single quotes are supported in wp-config.php!

If you use double quotes or single + double quotes mixed in wp-config.php, the script can't figure out the database credentials.

Bad: `define('DB_NAME', "db75994");`
Good - use only single quotes: `define('DB_NAME', 'db75994');`

(Debug this with a) connect to ssh `ddev ssh-production` and b) run `echo (cat wp-config.php | grep DB_NAME | cut -d \' -f 4)`, if this output is empty the bash parsing doesn't work properly for your site.) 

Please use only single quotes for all `DB_`-values in wp-config.php.

### Correct database type (mysql or maria db)?

Please make sure that the DDEV database type matches the database type of the backup / import. 

https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/extend/database_types/

### ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS (apache)

If .htaccess has a https-only rule with something like 'RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on', it will result in 'ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS'. Just remove these rules from .htaccess. https://twitter.com/m_andrasch/status/1481290725694349316

### WP Super Cache warnings

```
/wp-super-cache/wp-cache-base.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /var/www/html/wp-content/plugins/wp-super-cache/wp-cache.php on line 99`
Warning: include_once(/home/sites/site100026635/web/matthias-andrasch.eu/blog/wp-content/plugins/wp-super-cache/wp-cache-phase1.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /var/www/html/wp-content/advanced-cache.php on line 22
```
Just login into wp-admin/-dashboard, WP Super Cache will repair the path or remove the `define('WPCACHEHOME',..` line from pulled wp-config.php manually after import. 

### Emojis get lost after import and are replaced with ????

Update: This should be fixed now.

This is a charset issue I wasn't able to fix automatically yet. Please check your live sites `wp-config.php` and look for `DB_CHARSET`. Set this value in ssh.yaml for `REMOTE_DB_CHARSET=` and pull via ssh again (`ddev pull ssh`).

(Technical infos: It is related to DB_CHARSET set to something other than default 'utf8' in wp-config.php. For utf8mb4 the export needs to done with `mysqldump --default-character-set=utf8mb4` to be correct (https://stackoverflow.com/a/45301470/809939). But WordPress docs state DB_CHARSET setting may be not existent in wp-config.php, so we can't just read it from wp-config.php via bash, needs to be a conditional bash parsing from wp-config.php (See: https://wordpress.org/support/article/editing-wp-config-php/#database-character-set).)

## TODOs

- [ ] Use "- REMOTE_DB_CHARSET=utf8" as optional parameter, only use it in provider script if it is set
- [ ] Test SSH with password-based auth, should be working as well?
- [ ] Only single quotes are currently support with getting db values via bash (because of cut -d = delimiter is `'`)
- [ ] PHP 8.1 support? WP-CLI threw some errors, maybe fixed in new release? https://make.wordpress.org/cli/2022/01/26/wp-cli-v2-6-0-release-notes/
- [ ] Find out how to integrate https://git-updater.com/ within this workflow (See: https://github.com/afragen/git-updater/issues/716)
- [ ] Is https://github.com/jackd248/db-sync-tool more reliable? (ddev must be extended to support python), saw this via https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=nzxTPAMFssA)
